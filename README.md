## Abstract

Face photo-sketch synthesis plays an increasingly important role in the field of law enforcement and entertainment. However, most of the existing methods only focus on how to cross the modality differences between the photo domain and the sketch domain, while neglecting the image quality enhancement of the generated faces. In this paper, we propose a novel intra-domain enhancement (IDE) method for the face photo-sketch synthesis task. Our method is composed of two steps to cope with the inter-domain generation gap and the intra-domain quality defect respectively, i.e. inter-domain face generation and intra-domain face enhancement. In the inter-domain face generation stage, we apply a probabilistic graphical model which is capable of synthesizing the coarse face sketch from photos with low quality. In the intra-domain face enhancement stage, a multi-Layer feature Aggregation (MLA) based Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is designed to enhance the facial details in the sketches and further refine the synthesized image quality. Our first phase helps bridge the modality gap between photo and sketch and ensures the shape consistency between them, and the second phase aims to improve the detail quality and resolution of the synthesized sketches. Extensive experimental results on public face sketch databases illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

## Prerequisites

- Linux 
- Python 3.6
- MMCV 
- Pytorch
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA + CuDNN

## Getting Started

### Installation

* Clone this repo: 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/shenhaiyoualn/idesketch
  cd  idesketch/codes
  ```
  
* Create a conda environment and activate it
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  conda activate idesketch
  ```

### Preprocessing steps

If you need to use your own data, please align all faces by eyes.

Typically, there are four folders to be processed for CUHK dataset.

            CUHK_train_HR
            CUHK_train_LR/X2
            CUHK_test_HR
            CUHK_test_LR/X2
	   
The HR folder is the original image, and the LR folder is the result of inter-domain face generation, each sub_folder should have the same number of subimages.
Remember to modify the config file according to your settings.

We have prepared the script files under the /configs folder to process the data.
  ```
  cd codes
  python preprocess_CUHK_dataset.py
  python ann_file_prepare.py
  ```
### train/test

* Download CUFS and CUFSF dataset and put it in the dataset directory

* Train a model

  ```
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  ./tools/dist_train.sh configs/restorers/mlagan/mlagan_CUHK.py 1
  ```

* We provide testing scripts to evaluate a whole dataset, xxx.pth represents the model you trained.

  ```
  python tools/test.py configs/restorers/mlagan/mlagan_CUHK.py work_dirs/xxx.pth  --save-path work_dirs/results/
  ```
  Then, the test results of the images will be automatically generated in the work_dirs/results/ directory.
